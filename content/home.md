Hi, I'm [Andy Gao](https://andyjgao.com). Welcome to my [[public notebook]].

The notes you find here are of my own opinion on a wide array of topics. 

This page is also an experiment of mapping out my thoughts and see how they are connected to each other. 

Under each page, you will see a "Mentioned in" box whenever I reference a specific note in one of my other notes.

This site is still very raw and will most likely be updated in the near future.

Here are some recent notes:
- [[Feedback is essential for growth]]
- [[Default to writing Evergreen content]]
- [[Competitive spirals are an attribution to a Trend Mindset]]
- [[Compelling writing expresses big ideas with as few words as possible]]
- [[Constraints lead to freedom]]
- [[Systems with human centered designs are more efficient]]
- [[Memory is a trade off between accuracy and speed]]
- [[Keep things as simple as possible]]
- [[Mastering Product and Media leverage is where new fortunes are made]]
- [[Sharing establishes credibility]]
- [[Projects are absolutely essential to learning]]
- [[Side hustles are not startups]]
- [[Use writing as a tool for learning]]
