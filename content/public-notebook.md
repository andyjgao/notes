title: Public Notebook
---

A public notebook is a mix between raw notes and refined articles. Each note is a claim I believe to be true and are drawn from the books, articles, podcasts, and essays I consume. 

I am posting these notes because I strongly believe that you should [[publicize your ideas]].

I created this public notebook after being inspired by the public notes of [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes) and [Anne-Laure Le Cunff](https://www.mentalnodes.com/). 

This website was built off of [gatsby-theme-andy](https://github.com/aravindballa/gatsby-theme-andy) by the amazing [Avirand Balla](https://github.com/aravindballa) as well as some modifications of my own.
