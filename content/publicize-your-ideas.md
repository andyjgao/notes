title: Publicize your Ideas
aliases: ["publicize our ideas"]
---
You must publicize your ideas because a private idea is as good as no idea at all. Ideas and thoughts are meant to be written down, discussed and expressed.

If all scientists kept their ideas to themselves, there would be no innovation.

Publicizing your ideas also keeps you vulnerable, accountable, and open for collaboration.
