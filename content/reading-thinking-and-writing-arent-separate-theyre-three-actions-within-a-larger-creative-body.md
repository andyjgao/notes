title: Reading, thinking and writing aren't separate--they're three actions within a larger creative body
---

Reading, thinking and writing may seem like separate activities but they aren't. We need all three in order to learn and [[Use Writing as a tool for learning]]:
- We **read** to fill ourselves with ideas and knowledge
- We **think** to clarify, distill and reconstruct our ideas with previous knowledge.
- We **write** to reflect these ideas back as a way to process what we learned. We also write to share with the world and [[publicize our ideas]]
