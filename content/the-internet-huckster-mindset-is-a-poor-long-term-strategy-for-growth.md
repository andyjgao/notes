title: The Internet Huckster mindset is a poor-long term strategy for growth
---
The Internet huckster is someone who seeks to emulate others in an attempt to get rich quick. They lack originality and are more focused with promotion to acquire customer than creation of value. 

**The Huckster mindset:** I saw something my peers were doing that worked, I copied it, then when I got frustrated I started to get more aggressive about promoting it." - Nat Eliason

The huckster mindset is a poor-long term strategy for customer acquisition and growth because if people are not genuinely interested in you, they will only be a one-time customer.
