    My productivity strategy is based off of three pillars: Planning Ahead, Removing Distractions, and Maintaining Focus. 
    During college, I experimented a lot with productivity systems. I tried waking up at 4 am, using a bullet journal, etc. You name it. I’ve done it.
    I’ve come to realize that no matter what program or product you use, there are general principles that can be applied to any system.
    My productivity strategy is based on three pillars: **Plan Ahead, Remove Distractions and Maintain Focus.**
    ## Planning Ahead
    Planning should really be called investing your time. Just as we invest money in the stock market to increase our wealth, we should invest minutes in planning to __save hours in the future.__
    I split planning into Weekly Planning and Daily Planning.
    ### Weekly Planning
        Every Sunday, I spend roughly 30 minutes to plan for the week ahead. I start by examining my Project List and see what outstanding tasks I have to finish.
        ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FGr23n_h1sA.png?alt=media&token=c5eae831-bdb9-4d48-8946-6c23d6b7aecb)
        __Note: A Project can be replaced with a class, a course, or any large deliverable.__
        Afterwards, I compile all of my todos into a weekly task list and assigned it to different days through the week.
            ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FYC6vbT4qMx.png?alt=media&token=3a40d44c-fe19-440f-a043-e2f66a3091e7)
        This simple weekly routine has drastically improved my efficiency in completing projects and has taken the mental load of figuring what I need to do each day.
    ### Daily Planning
        Before I sleep each night, I take a look and review what needs to be done the following day (via weekly plan). This helps my mind subconsciously prepare for the next day. I make this process easier by writing down a general schedule.
          ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FQ3mr0I3xO2.png?alt=media&token=265cb471-e11b-4980-80f7-144a6c809079)
        I almost never adhere to the schedule exactly (life is unexpected) but it does give me a framework and time range for completing each activity.  Just like weekly planning, daily planning removes the uncertainty of a day and limits [procrastination caused by abstract goals](https://www.spring.org.uk/2009/01/how-to-avoid-procrastination-think.php). 
    ## Remove Distractions
        Removing distractions is essential to being productive. It takes around [23 minutes](https://www.themuse.com/advice/this-is-nuts-it-takes-nearly-30-minutes-to-refocus-after-you-get-distracted) to refocus after getting distracted, so it is in our best interest to reduce distractions as much as possible.
        ### Work During Off-Hours
            If distractions are due to notifications ringing on our phone and the messages we have to respond to, working when everyone else is asleep drastically reduces the number of minutes wasted by these hindrances.
            When you wake up earlier (or sleep a lot later), you grant yourself hours of undisturbed focus where you can do [deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/) (meaningful work).
        ### Separate your Work Environment
            I used to work in the same room as my bed, and this made napping SO EASY. If I got stuck on a bug while programming or had writer’s block, I would roll into bed and take a nap. This destroyed my productivity.
            Our surroundings have a certain amount of influence on the [psychological states and choices we make.](http://healthysleep.med.harvard.edu/healthy/getting/overcoming/tips) Physically separating where we work and relax can help us also create a mental separation as well.
        ### No Phones
            This one is simple, just don’t use it. When you work, put your phone away. A general rule of thumb is to keep it out-of-sight and 7 seconds away.
    ## Maintain Focus
        Now that we’ve created a plan, and removed distractions, the final task is to maintain focus while we work.
        ### Meditation
            [Meditation](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/why-i-love-meditation/) helps increase the grey-matter in our brain, which is directly correlated to focus and attention. Through meditation, we can prolong the duration of focus on an activity and produce higher quality work.
        ### Pomodoro Technique
            The Pomodoro Technique is a system where you choose a task to focus on for 25 minutes before taking a 5-minute break. After four cycles, you take a longer 20-minute break. Then you rinse and repeat. I found this to be the most effective strategy for long-term focus because the breaks are long enough to help your mind recover from intense concentration but short enough that you do not become distracted.
            Once you become comfortable, you can increase the duration of each focus-session.
            Currently, I use the [PomoTab](https://www.andyjgao.com/projects/pomotab/) Chrome Extension, but there are also plenty of other options online.
    And that’s it. By **Planning, Removing Distractions, and Maintaining Focus,** you will be able to maximize what you can accomplish in any given day.
