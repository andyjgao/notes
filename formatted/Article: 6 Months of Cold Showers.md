    Intro
        The first time I tried this, I screamed expletives loud enough to wake my roommates up. __F*king Ballsacks. Who enjoys this sh*t? This is cold, painful and uncomfortable__  
        But having decided to commit to it for 30 days, I carried on. 
        And after the 30 day challenge was over, I continued. Not because someone forced me to, but because I wanted to. 
        Today marks my 6 month journey into cold showers and I wanted to share some things I've learned.
    Why cold showers?
        I first heard of cold showers through a YouTube video by Wim Hof. In it, he lays out the scientific evidence behind taking cold showers. He mentions that cold showers will...
            [Increase the Immune System](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5025014/)
            [Reduce Pain](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4049052/)
            [Reduce Stress](https://www.wimhofmethod.com/how-to-relieve-stress)
        That seemed pretty cool so I gave it try.
        While these benefits were the reason I started to take cold showers, the mental improvements are the reasons I kept this habit up for so long. It's also what I want to focus on. Here's what I've noticed :
            Improved Mental Clarity
                Being surrounded by the freezing cold changes your mental state. No matter what you are feeling at the time-- sadness, sleepiness, etc-- when you step into the shower, the freezing water will jolt you into a sense of awareness of the present moment. There's just no way you can worry about relationships or schoolwork when the cold is attacking your buttocks. Trust me.  
            The Pursuit of the Uncomfortable
                Even after sixth months of taking cold showers, I've never once entered the shower with excitement. The last thing I want to do after leaving the warm cocoon of my comforter is to be splashed with a glacial spray of water. However, the habit of seeking the uncomfortable as the first thing I do when I wake up transformed me.
                I discovered that all the excuses I had in my daily life were the same excuses that I told myself right before I jumped into the shower. 
                __It's going to be painful.__
                _It's going to be uncomfortable. __
                And if I was able to conquer the shower, why couldn't I conquer the day?
            Less Urges for Instant Gratification
                Think for a second what it is like when you take a warm shower. It feels relaxing and quite frankly amazing after a long, stressful day. But once you exit the shower, you shiver frigidly and look for the nearest towel to wrap yourself.
                The inverse is true when you take a cold shower. During the moment, it feels like hell. There's nothing you want to do but leave. Yet, if you stay in there long enough (5 minutes minimum), your body is on fire when you get out. And this warmth continues for another 30 minutes or so.
                There's a lesson to be learned here. When we delay instant gratification, we are rewarded at the end.
                Whether it's directly due to taking cold showers or not, I've observed that, at least subconsciously, my proclivity towards instant gratification has reduced drastically.
        What's next?
            I know, for certain, that I won't be stopping cold showers anytime soon, and I hope I've made you at least curious about trying it out. If you are interested here is my challenge to you:
                For 30 days, turn the knob on your shower from hot to cold and embrace being uncomfortable.
            If you do take on this challenge, let me know! 
        It's washed away the mental barriers I've built up for myself and allowed me to embrace the uncomfortable.
