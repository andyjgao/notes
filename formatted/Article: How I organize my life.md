    - Life is hectic and chaotic. But that doesn't mean you have to be. 
    - I want to share the system I use to organize my thoughts, projects, and life.
    - After implementing the system for the past three months, I can confidently say that it's one of the main contributors to how I am able to stay consistent in getting things done.
    - The system is broken down into 4 components:
        - **Capture:** collecting to-dos, insightful thoughts and ideas.
        - **Process:** Organizing and filtering captures 
        - **Plan:** Setting deadlines to to-dos
        - **Execute:** Implementing Plan
    - ## Capture
        -  On average, a person consumes [34 gigabytes of data](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743) a day. News, Instagram feeds, books, articles. 
        - In either case, we need a method of capture-- a way to remember what we found insightful. **A method of capture must be easy to use, readily accessible, and transferrable between different mediums.**
        - The tool I use for capture is Google Keep but you can use a small notebook or anything that satisfies the requirement of capture above. 
        - Photos

    - ## Process
        - The next step is to process what is captured. 
        - 
        - I organize what I capture in a knowledge database such as Evernote, Notion, or Roam Research (I personally use Roam Research).
        - There are three categories I break my captures into when I store them: 
            - Smart Notes
            - Current Projects
            - Future Projects
        - ### Smart Notes
