        - Lack of structure. 
        - Daily Pages
    - ## Task Management
        - Task Management for me starts by creating a weekly plan where I list out the things I want to accomplish in a week. Then, I organize these tasks throughout the days of the week. 
        - Roam is very useful for this because of both it's Daily Page feature and bidirectional linking.
        - I have a page called **Weekly Plan**. Under **Tasks**, I nest my TODO list for the week and under the **current month** (May 2020), I paste my weekly template.

        - Planning out my week now is as simple as dragging my tasks under the day in which I want to complete them.

        - The coolest part about all of this is since each page is bidirectionally linked and each date is a page, the tasks I've dragged under the days of week automatically show up as a "Linked Reference" when the day appears.

        - This is perhaps one the **best features** about doing task management in Roam. To the best of my knowledge, you can't do it in Notion, Evernote, etc.  
    - ## Personal Knowledge Management:
        - We process an [average of 34 gigabytes](https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/viewFile/1566/743) of information daily. It would be a waste if we weren't able to save things we found interesting. Being able to collect important content for future use is something Roam does especially well. 
        - I save information through taking notes using the methods described in Sonke Ahren's [How to Take Smart Notes](https://www.andyjgao.com/notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/)
        - Here is an example of a note I took on [Combinational creativity: the myth of originality](https://nesslabs.com/combinational-creativity):
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FAr6jBwUB5g.png?alt=media&token=807fe95d-a6fc-488a-844f-935ffd3e51c5)
        - So far, this looks like taking notes on any other note-taking app. __What's different?__ Bidirectional linking.
        - Since each one of my notes is written under the "Literature Notes" link, I can now reference every note I've written easily. 
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FMRQnX-gaaa.png?alt=media&token=3ae7ffb9-21d0-4fe7-926d-273e3df54603)
        - However, the magic doesn't end there. By using tags for your notes, when you click on a specific tag (hashtag writing), I can see all notes related to writing.

        - One of the main frictions I've had when using tools like Notion or Evernote is the frustration of figuring out where each note should be filed under. With Roam, the friction is completely removed due to the new system of bidirectional linking. Write once, link(file) everywhere.
