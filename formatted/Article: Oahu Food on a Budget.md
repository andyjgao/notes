- ## Draft
    - Intro
        - With its breath-taking views, friendly locals, and delicious food, Hawaii is one of the top vacation spots in the world. However, it is also known to be quite pricey. A one-week vacation for two will cost upwards of $4,000, especially if you are visiting Oahu. 
        - A local in Hawaii told us that you go to Kauai to get married, Maui to bump shoulders with celebrities, and you go to Oahu for traffic and expensive food.
        - As recently graduated college students, Amy and I were low on capital and thus we budgeted our money to make the most out of the food Oahu has to offer. Without further ado, here are the:
    - ##  Top 5 Best Cheap Eats Waikiki
        - **Rainbow Drive-in**
            - 5/5
            - We stumbled upon this place as a recommendation by our Costco Representative who picked us up from the airport. We asked him for his favorite joint in Hawaii, and he told us [Rainbow Drive-in](https://rainbowdrivein.com/) was his top choice. And boy oh boy, we were so glad to have listened to his advice.
            - Amy and I decided to split the Hawaiian Plate Lunch (which was definitely enough to feed both of us). The plate consisted of BBQ Beef, Boneless Chicken and Mahi Mahi over two scoops of rice and one scoop of macaroni salad. Every piece of meat/fish was cooked to perfection. The insides were extremely tender and juicy while the outside maintained a nice crust. 
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FQ4w1niAcax?alt=media&token=cb3176ce-06fa-494f-9ff5-370773c48bc7)
            - It cost us $10.50, and split amongst the two of us, the total per person ends up being $5.25.
        - **Hawaii Crown Plantation**
            - 4.5/5
            - This is an amazing place for a nice afternoon snack or a morning breakfast. Hawaiian Crown Plantation Cafe offers a wide variety of different fruit smoothies /drinks but is most known for its Acai Bowl.  The bowl comes with Acai topped with granola, strawberries, blueberries, pineapples, bananas, local macadamia nuts, raw honey & cacao nibs
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FPvThw4Eaju?alt=media&token=048268e9-75a0-44ab-9250-643125e20904)
            - At $10.03 for a large, the acai bowl may seem at first a questionable pick--on a list for Top Cheap Eats --but here is why we found it to be a steal. As Acai bowls come, the price of $10.03 is already on the lower end considering some bowls range upwards of $14-$15. However, as soon as you take your first bite, you'll know that every cent you paid for was worth it. Each bite was so fresh and delicious. The people at Hawaiian Crown Plantation really did an amazing job combining all of the different flavors together. It was SO GOOD that we came back again during our trip to grab another bowl
        - **Doraku**
            - 3.9/5
            - If you like sushi/poke/japanese food, Doraku is a perfect option for Happy Hour with all items less than $10. While the quantity of one dish is not enough to fill you up, for $6 poke this is more than worth it --especially given the quality of fish they serve. And for the readers over the legal drinking age, their cocktails are very, very good. You will not regret it.
            - Amy and I got the Ahi Tuna Poke ($6), Tuna Tataki ($6), Lychee Martini($6), and the Momotaro Lemonade ($6)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FsBBtAwxpt4?alt=media&token=064586f5-293b-456b-81f6-6ec0f0d427c4)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FY4VFqhImjM?alt=media&token=1012c640-49e3-46ea-8ac3-0487d185dd0b)
        - **Musubi Cafe IYASUME**
            - 5/5
            - Hawaiian's adoption of many different cultures is distinctively present in their food. And perhaps one of the best examples on display is the Musubi. Musubi is a block of rice tied to a piece of meat(usually spam) using nori (seaweed), combining both American staples and Japanese tradition. 
            - Our favorite spot serving Musubi is the **Musubi Cafe IYASUME** 
            - With prices ranging from $1.98 to $4.00 per Musubi, this is by far one the best cheap eat joints Oahu has to offer. **Musubi Cafe IYASUME**  serves Musubi's with a myriad of toppings including Avacodo, Egg, Bacon, cucumber, eel and more.  However,  **Musubi Cafe IYASUME** offers much more than just Musubi. Amy and I also bought a full-sized Poke Bowl for only $8.99.  
            - **Note:** Lines are often very long during breakfast, so it may be best to go during off-hours.

        - **Maguro Spot**
            - 4.5/5
            - Maguro Spot was right next the Hilton Waikiki Hotel we were staying in. After passing by it countless times, we decided to go take a look.
            - Their poke deals are unbeatable. It only costs $5 for a small bowl of poke (which is enough in my opinion). It was super super fresh, it almost felt like it came straight from the ocean. 
            - We highly recommend the the Spicy Mayo Poke Bowls offered.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FPXqRfBTLhy?alt=media&token=857b906a-abd9-4066-818d-fa3be65494e1)
        - **Kono's Northshore**
            - 4/5
            - For meatlovers, Kono's Northshore is a must visit. Kono's Northshore is known for perfecting and serving one of Hawaiian's traditional staples: Kalua Pork.
            -  We ordered the Pork Plate Lunch ($11.95) which consisted of 12-hour slow-roasted Kalua pulled pork, white rice, mesclun salad, homemade guava bbq sauce, and homemade papaya seed dressing. This was more than enough to feed 2. The pork was absolutely phenomenal, it literally melts in your mouth, and is perfectly complemented by the white rice. If you want an extra flavor kick, Kono's also provides different housemade hot sauces to try. We got the Habenero and Mango Pineapple.
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F2h4lcMFzLC?alt=media&token=1a57ec79-1c51-4971-9c20-235f52d58c91)
        - **Marukame Udon Waikiki**
            - Marukame Udon is casual dining restaurant that offers udon noodles at unbeatable prices ($4 for a bowl what?!?!). As soon as you enter the restaurant you walk down an isle and:
                - Grab a tray
                - Tell the server behind the counter what udon you want from their menu
                - Pick up the udon (~1 min wait time)
                - Choose from an array of tempura options as side items
                - Pay at the end of the isle
            - This meal was very filling and delicious. The noodles are house-made and extremely bouncy. However, one thing to note is that the broth is quite salty, so make sure to order water as well.
            - "![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FluKC0iINNo?alt=media&token=fab526a4-716d-473d-b363-879e15c6c7cc)"
