    ## Intro
        Let's say you were given two choices: $1,000 a month vs $20/month with 10% growth each month 
        Which would you choose? 
        If you chose $1,000 you would be correct -- but only for 5 years. 
        In 3.5 years, option B would yield a monthly income of $1,095.27. In 5 years, option B's cumulative income would surpass Option A's cumulative income ($60,000 vs $60,696.33). In roughly 5.5 years, Option B's cumulative income would have doubled Option A's.

        A compound interest investment, or option B, becomes a no-brainer. But what is the key takeaway? From option B, we learn that growth no matter how small is better than stagnation.
        In life, you should choose Option B. Follow a compound effect strategy toward your goals and you will reap the rewards.
    ## Implementing the compound effect strategy
        Darren Hardy describes it best in his book, __The Compound Effect__, when he states that the compound effect strategy is doing seemingly insignificant actions consistently. 
        Hardy describes in his book two people who start out at the same weight. One person increases his daily caloric intake by 125 calories, and the other decreasing 125 calories. While insignificant at first, after 2.5 years, one becomes very fat while the other becomes skinny. 
        So how do you effectively implement the compound strategy? 
        ### Breaking down goals
            The next time you have a goal in mind, break it down from a large task into daily task and you will find that it is far easier than you imagined. Imagine having a goal of reading 30 books in a year. An average book is ~[250 pages](https://www.megcabot.com/about-meg-cabot/frequently-asked-questions-getting-published/) and let's say you read 25 pages a day. In a year, you would have finished 36.5 books.  
        ### Track your progress
            Journaling your progress is equally as important when implementing the compound effect strategy. By journaling your progress, you can tangibly see when you deviate from your plan and when you are progressing effectively in your goals. 
        ### Consistency
            The most important of them all is consistency. Consistency is the foundation of the compound effect. You can break down your goals and track your progress but if you are not doing this regularly, the compound effect will not happen.
        **The key to implementing the compound strategy is consistency. **
        This strategy works almost 100% of the time. I've done it to learn to program, read more, and reach my fitness goals.
    ## What's next?
        Now that we've discussed the steps of the Compound Effect, the next step is to take action. Find a goal or skill that you've always wanted to learn and break it down. Make progress on it no matter how small and reap the rewards at the end.
        Hopefully, by the end of quarantine, you've developed that new skill you always aspired to have.
