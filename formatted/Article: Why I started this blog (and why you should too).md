    I started this blog and you should create one too. Here's why
    Publicize your Ideas
        Societal advancement would have never been possible if everyone kept their thoughts to themselves. Imagine if Albert Einstein never publicized his ideas on the Theory of Relativity or if Thomas Edison decided to keep his light bulb to himself. As humans, we would have lost a lot.
        Similarly, we should publicize our ideas as well. In Sonke Ahren's book [How to Take Smart Notes](https://andyjgao.com/notes/how-to-take-smart-notes/), he writes that "an idea kept private is as good as one you never had". This is because to everyone else, it is the same as if you never even came up with the idea.
        Ideas are meant to be written down, discussed, and expressed. By publicizing them, you are able to keep yourself vulnerable, accountable and open for collaboration. 
    Use writing as a tool for synthesizing knowledge
        You write when you text, you write when you email. Everything in in life revolves around it. Whether it be studying, research, academia or expression -- writing is used. 
        When we synthesize our thoughts physically on paper, we are able to examine it and dissect it. It acts as a self-test as to whether you remember what you've learned. The next time you want to see if you understand a topic, try writing it out and see how much you know. Chances are you might know a lot less than you thought. This is because often times being familiar with a topic is an illusion of understanding a topic.  
        A blog is useful because publishing your work publically means you need to work extra hard to understand the topic you are writing about.
    Projects are essential for learning
        Regardless of what skill you want to pick up, projects are an essential way to learn. They are aimed at narrowing your focus by giving you a goal to accomplish and a deadline to meet, allowing you to plan and execute.
        Projects can also give you a place to immediately apply concepts you've learned.
        Let's say I want to improve my writing. Without a project to link to this goal, this is simply a dream. I can dream all day of being the next Shakespeare, but I am left with no actionable plan or task to develop this skill. 
        I started this blog as a project to improve my writing with each post then becoming an actionable task to be accomplished. 
    A way to document my self as I evolve
        Every day, I absorb content through books, articles, tweets, etc. As I interact with these mediums, my beliefs and views naturally change as well. Through this blog, I hope to be able to document this journey as I grow as an individual. Five years ago, I was different from who I am now. Five years later, I will be different too.
    Why You should create a Blog too
        The reasons I listed above are why I created this website, but they can also pertain to you as well! To recap, You should create a blog because:
            **Publicizing your ideas** keeps you vulnerable, accountable and open for collaboration
            **Writing is the best way to synthesize knowledge**
            Creating **projects are the best way to learn**
            It provides you **a way to document your growth**
        And it's Free! (using the proper methods)
