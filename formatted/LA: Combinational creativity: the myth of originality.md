            - Creativity can be cultivated, not only just innate
            - There are three main types of creativity: exploratory, transformational, and **combinational creativity.**
            - Combinational Creativity
                - Process of combining old ideas with new.
                - Three types of combinational creativity:
                    - Problem-driven: combining two old ideas to solve a problem
                    - Similarity-driven: combining two ideas similar in concept (E.g. spork)
                    - Inspiration-driven: combining two seemingly unrelated ideas after mind forms a connection.

    - "A common misconception is that creativity cannot be cultivated, and that instead some lucky people have an innate sense of creativity." ([Cunff 2019:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=1))
    - "there are three main types of creativity: exploratory, transformational, and combinational creativity" ([Cunff 2019:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=1))
    - "most new ideas come from combinational creativity" ([Cunff 2019:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=1))
    - "In the words of William Inge, and English author: "Originality is undetected plagiarism."" ([Cunff 2019:1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=1))
    - "Combinational creativity is the process of combining old ideas to come up with something new." ([Cunff 2019:2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=2))
    - "Problem-driven. Let's say there is a gap between a problem and the current solution. In combinational creativity, a problem-driven approach would consist in trying to bridge that gap by combining old ideas. These old ideas may offer an incomplete solution on their own but, once combined, prove to be a powerful solution. In the paper, scientists give the example of "combining a socket (the object) and an umbrella (the problem-solving idea) to produce a rainproof socket (the target)."" ([Cunff 2019:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=3))
    - "Similarity-driven. Some concepts are naturally associated inside our mind because they share similar functions, designs, and purposes. For example, a cup may make you think about a glass, a spoon about a fork, etc. While these associations are common, they can still bring novel ideas to life. The "spork"â€”a mix of spoon and fork, is a great example of similarity-driven combinational creativity." ([Cunff 2019:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=3))
    - "Inspiration-driven. This form of combinational creativity occurs when our mind connects two seemingly unrelated ideas to form a new one. For example, the "Juicy Salif" product below was designed by Philippe Starck by combining the idea of a lemon squeezer and a dish of squids he ordered at a waterfront" ([Cunff 2019:3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=3))
    - "restaurant. Seemingly random and unique, but still an example of combinational creativity" ([Cunff 2019:4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ASE4U7MA?page=4))
