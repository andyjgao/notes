        - The key to killing email capture is very counterintuitive:** Do not actively seek to capture emails.**
        - Instead, making email capture a byproduct of **great content**. If your content is amazing, people will willingly signup for your email. And these are the people who will **buy your product, read your emails, follow you willingly**
        - "Many writers get the causality reversed when it comes to building an audience. You don’t build something successful (blog, book, podcast) by building up a huge audience via email, twitter, facebook, etc. Rather, you build up a huge audience by building something successful."
- Highlights:
    - **There is not a single newsletter I was coerced into joining that I enjoy or have stayed subscribed to**
    - . For the few newsletters that I do allow in my inbox, I went to the site and sought out their signup form because I liked their work.
    - I don’t think I’m alone in this. I recently purged a portion of my email list, realizing that there were old signups who were inactive. Before I deleted them, I went through their information and found something interesting:
    - **almost 100% of the inactive subscribers were the ones who signed up through a content upgrade or lead magnet.**
    - And why do you need to aggressively capture emails, anyway? Many Internet marketers treat email as a magic source of traffic that your site can’t survive without, but that’s simply not true.
    - This site has grown to 200,000+ monthly readers, substantially more than most blogs, with almost no impact from email. The vast majority of that traffic comes from SEO and social sharing because **the articles are very good**.
    - Many writers get the causality reversed when it comes to building an audience. You don’t build something successful (blog, book, podcast) by building up a huge audience via email, twitter, facebook, etc. Rather, you build up a huge audience by building something successful.
    - In a desire to feel important and appreciated, people jump the gun and try to collect attention before they deserve it.
