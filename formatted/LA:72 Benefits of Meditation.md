        - Meditating for even 20 minutes/day is enough to start experiencing large benefits
        - Benefits:
            1. Brain & Moods
                1. Decreases Depression
                    1. ""In a study conducted at five middle schools in Belgium, involving about 400 students (13 ~ 20 years old), Professor Filip Raes concludes that "students who follow an in-class mindfulness program report reduced indications of depression, anxiety and stress up to six months later. Moreover, these students were less likely to develop pronounced depressionlike symptoms."" ([ :2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6KZHTWQP?page=2))"
                    2. ""High-risk pregnant women who participated in a ten-week mindfulness yoga training saw significant reductions in depressive symptoms, according to a University of Michigan Health System pilot feasibility study." ([ :3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6KZHTWQP?page=3))"
                    3. Reduce Stress & Anxiety
                        1. Source: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-meditation-overrated/
                        2. ""A study from the University of Wisconsin-Madison indicates that the practice of "Open Monitoring Meditation" (such as Vipassana), reduces the grey-matter density in areas of the brain related with anxiety and stress." ([ :3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6KZHTWQP?page=3))"
                2. Increase Grey Matter Concentration in Brain
                    1. ""the grey matter concentration increases in areas of the brain involved in learning and memory, regulating emotions, sense of self, and having perspective." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6KZHTWQP?page=4))"
                    2. https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/psychiatry-research-neuroimaging
                3. Decrease Sleep Need? (This seems questionable)
                    1. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2919439/
            2. Mind & Performance
                1. Improves focus, attention, and ability under stress
                    1. "A study led by Katherine MacLean of the University of California suggested that during and after meditation training, subjects were more skilled at keeping focus, especially on repetitive and boring tasks." ([ :6](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/6KZHTWQP?page=6))"
                    2. https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/CABN.7.2.109[page-1](<page-1.md>)
                2. Improves info processing and decision-making
                    1. Eileen Luders, an assistant professor at the UCLA Laboratory of Neuro Imaging, and colleagues, have found that long-term meditators have larger amounts of gyrification (“folding” of the cortex, which may allow the brain to process information faster) than people who do not meditate. Scientists suspect that gyrification is responsible for making the brain better at processing information, making decisions, forming memories and improving attention
                    2. https://newsroom.ucla.edu/
                3. Improves learning, memory, self-awareness
                    1. Long-term practice of meditation increases grey-matter density in the areas of the brain associated with learning, memory, self-awareness, compassion, and introspection.

                4. Reduces Multitasking
                    1. ""Multitasking is not only a dangerous productivity myth, but it's also a source of stress. "Changing gears" between activities is costly for the brain, and induces feelings of distraction and dissatisfaction from the work being done."
