        - Determining whether you need a niche boils down to a simple question: 
            - **What's Your Goal?**
                - If it's to sell products, then have a niche.
                - If not, create the best content possible.
        - **Problems of having a Niche:**
            - Niches lead to content fatigue and leads to low quality, non-detailed articles
            - Getting bored from writing the same content
            - Easier to replace than the narrowest niche -- you
        - **Challenges of Not having a Niche**
            - Marketing is Harder
            - Monetization is Harder (but you shouldn't focus on monetization. Focus on quality)
        - **Blog without a Niche**
            - by experimenting liberally
            - by focusing on quality first
            - then, focus on SEO and Social
- Highlights
    - **What’s your goal?**
    - The point of most blogs is not to create good writing or to inform people as best as possible, but to sell things.
    - If you’re starting a blog to sell a product, then certainly, you should niche down
    - ## Three Problems with Having a Niche
    - ### Problem 1: Niches Lead to Content Fatigue
    - The only content worth writing is in-depth, useful articles that people can refer to for years to come, and when you pick a narrow niche, you will run out of those topics very quickly.
    - By being free to jump around to multiple topics, I can provide more detailed, high information posts without burning my list of ideas out. I never have to try to make up new information on a topic, and I never have to split the value of a post into multiple ones to ensure I can keep my posting schedule.
    - ### Problem 2: You Might Get Bored
    - ### Problem 3: You’re More Replaceable
    - The biggest problem with the “you need a niche!” argument applied to blogging is that it’s ignoring the narrowest niche in the world: you.
    - ## Challenges of Not Having a Niche
    - ### Marketing is Harder
    - When you do your blog in this style and don’t give yourself a clear niche, it’s harder to sell people on reading your blog or subscribing to it.
    - ### Monetization is Harder
    - My approach is to keep writing articles about what I’m interested in, and then create products around the topics that do well.
    - The last thing I’ll say on monetization is that I deliberately under-monetize the site.
    - ## How to Blog Without a Niche
    - ### Experiment Liberally
    - Since you have no niche, you can write about literally anything you want, and you should! You never know what sub-niches you’ll discover from experimenting.
    - ### Focus on Quality First
    - You also need to dispense with any notions of putting marketing first or spending “20% of your time on content creation, and 80% on promotion.”
    - ### Then Focus on SEO and Social
    - Email marketing won’t work as well for an un-niched blog since your calls to action won’t be as strong. Instead, focus on SEO and social media.
