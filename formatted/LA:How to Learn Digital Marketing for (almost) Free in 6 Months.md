        - 2) Building your Sandbox (1-7 Days)
            - Sandbox has a few criteria:
                1. Low-cost/free
                2. Low-stakes
                3. Public
        - 3) Practice
            - After building sandbox, you should start marketing experiments and track it via spreadsheets and run your first few experiments.
        - 4) Research and Iterate
            1. Run a few marketing experiments (usually for ~1-2 weeks)
            2. If successful, turn it into a system and iterate.
            3. If failure, find another one to run
