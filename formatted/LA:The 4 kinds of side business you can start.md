        - Side Hustles need to 
            1. solve a problem someone is already aware of
            2. give someone something they’re looking for
            3. NOT require a lot of maintenance or hand-holding
            4. have a no-brainer path to profitability
        - 4 Ways to build a successful side hustle:
            - Buy an existing asset
                - Think real-estate
            - Launch a product on a marketplace with existing demand
                - Think Udemy/Skillshare
                - To succeed, research a marketplace and look for where people are spending money and create a product **you are passionate about**
                - this side hustle results in [compound interest](<compound interest.md>) (temporarily)
            - Launch a unique product where you can buy demand
                - Focus on small niches, to avoid ton of competition
                - Be able to acquire customer via paid acquisition
                - Solve a problem several thousand people have
                - Look for niche products that have success elsewhere and apply to your own niche
                    - (e.g. daily journals => apply to your own niche)
            - Arbitrage
                - Least favorable option for side hustle
                - Become saturated quickly
                - Opportunity rare
                - Take a lot of up-front time to find
                - Makes money quick however

    - "the biggest key to successful side hustles that i've seen? understanding that you're not starting a startup." ([ :1](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=1))
    - "side hustles can grow and evolve, but to work they need to have a few traits. they need to: solve a problem someone is already aware of give someone something they're looking for NOT require a lot of maintenance or hand-holding have a no-brainer path to profitability" ([ :2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=2))
    - "as far as i've thought about it, i think there are 4 ways you can build a successful side hustle:^^ 1. buy an existing asset 2. launch a product on a marketplace with existing demand 3. launch a unique, one of a kind product in a new space where you can buy demand (adwords, facebook, etc.) 4. arbitrage (craigslist, airbnb, trading, uber)^^" ([ :2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=2))
    - "spend time on a marketplace where people are spending money, and figure out how to create a product that people are looking for." ([ :2](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=2))
    - "if you can find a niche on a marketplace that you think you'll be able to own with some time, the results can be remarkable. this is the truest side hustle there is, as the marketplace will do the hard work of acquiring and servicing customers for you." ([ :3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=3))
    - "if i were to start another side business now, the platforms i'd look at are: ^^skillshare / udemy ebay / amazon amazon ebooks the shopify app store the google chrome app store any sort of niche marketplace where people buy stuff: wordpress themes, woocommerce themes, etc. airbnb^^" ([ :3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=3))
    - "this one is the most similar to building a startup. however, there are a few things that make this different: ^^you want to focus strictly on small niches. not because you don't want to make money, but because you don't want to face a ton of competition. the smaller the space, the less likely it is that a larger company launches a similar product, or a VC-backed startup raises $5mm to come after you. not fun.^^ you must be able to acquire customers via paid acquisition: ads on facebook, instagram and google. your product must be unique, or uniquely solve a niche problem that several thousand people have." ([ :3](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=3))
    - "a good way to get ideas in this area is to look at niche products that have been successful elsewhere and apply them to a niche you care about." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=4))
    - "the other iteration i've seen work well here is applying your skills to a niche in a way that's a low time investment but high ROI for your clients. for example, if you have some expertise in a/b testing, set up and run 1-3 a/b tests for e-commerce or saas businesses a month. charge 1-2k, and give high-level reporting." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=4))
    - "firrst, they tend to become crowded pretty quickly. markets trend towards efficiency, which makes it really hard to consistently have very profitable arbitrage opportunities." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=4))
    - "econdly, these sorts of arbitrage opportunities can be rare, which makes them not ideal for a side business (since the income is unpredictable." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=4))
    - "lastly, arbitrages can take a lot of time up-front to find, and can go away quickly enough that the up-front investment isn't worth it." ([ :4](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/7A5DK3MC?page=4))
