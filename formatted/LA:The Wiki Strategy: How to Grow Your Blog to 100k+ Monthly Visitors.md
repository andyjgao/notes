        - Principle 1: Create the Best Content Online
            - If you are going to post an article, make sure you write the **best** article possible on that topic or else it's a waste of your time.
            - Example: Wikipedia. People read Wikipedia because its content is vetted to be of the highest caliber.
        - Principle 2: Create Rabbit Holes: Don't Make Readers Leave
            - Every time you link something, link it to another post on your site. This **keeps people on your site**
            - Take note of what you link out: **every link should be another article you write**
            - This will create a rabbit hole effect
        - Principle 3: Don't be a slave to keywords
            - Do not fall for the trap of sacrificing the quality of article for high-value keywords
        - Principle 4: Get other People to Write with you
            - It's impossible to always churn out the best content. 
            - Try and have other people write for you, either via interviews or other mediums.
        - Principle 5: Good Sourcing
            - Cite from reputable sources.
        - Mechanics for a content machine:
            - **Setting and Tracking your Content Marketing Goals**
                - Start with sales goal sourced from blog content
                    - Example: Grow to 300 widgets/month sold via blog traffic in 6 months
                        - **Sales goal: **Grow to 300 widgets/month sold via blog traffic in 6 months
                        - **Conversion Goal:** 1% of visitors convert to buy
                        - **Traffic Goal:** 300/0.01 = 30,000 visitors per month in 6 months
            - **Tracking**
                - Use a spreadsheet to track your progress
            - **Choosing and Planning Content**
                - A good template is to create an article that has a list:
                    - ex: [130 Ways to Get More Website Traffic: A Sumo-Sized Guide](https://sumo.com/stories/get-more-traffic?src=nat).
                - Start off with linking to other sites. But as you build content link each way to your site
            - **SEO Informed, not Driven**
                - Use SEO to prioritize opportunity of content, not as a way to determine content.
                    - Go to website like ahrefs
                    - Type in keyword
                    - Find website that has the top search of keyword and look for what keywords its ranking for
                    - Get an idea of what keywords you should use based on KW volume and difficulty
            - **Abide by Deadlines, They are not suggestions**
            - **Promote Content**
                - 80% on Content, 20% on Promotion
                - Promotion system
                    - Non-annoying email collection + newsletter for new articles
                    - Automated social sharing with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) + evergreen sharing with [Postplanner](https://www.postplanner.com/)
                    - Hiring someone to plug articles on reddit
