- [Hawaii](<Hawaii.md>) Day 4: Maui
    - Woke up ~8am
    - Went to Avis to ask about our Jeep pricing because we thought it was way overpriced. $266 dollars for 3.5 days. Orig, we thought that young driver's fee was on top of $266 but after talking with Avis we realized its included in the $266

        - Amazing Lunch Spot with an amazing Chef
        - Tin Roof's name is rooted from the Chef's humble beginnings where the sound of rain pattering on his Tin Roof brought sense of home and belonging
            - This idea is strongly displayed in his cooking as well.
            - The chef infuses home cooking into the Hawaiian cuisine offering
                - mochiko chicken
                - poke
                - pork belly and more

    - **['Iao Valley](<'Iao Valley.md>):** https://dlnr.hawaii.gov/dsp/parks/maui/iao-valley-state-monument/
        - 'Iao Valley has a very beautiful scenery of the  mountains and valleys that gives Maui its name as the Maui Isle
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2Fqe4tcwiztM?alt=media&token=90905b29-4ffe-46b0-b9f1-1c36cdf762dc)
        - It is also known for a phallic shaped mountain

    - **[Haleakalā](<Haleakalā.md>):** https://www.nps.gov/hale/index.htm
        - Haleakala is perhaps one the biggest attractions in Maui
        - 10,023′ feet above sea level
        - Its a massive shield volcano that forms over 75% of the island
        - Known for its stunning views and amazing hikes
        - Note: it takes roughly 2 hours to drive to the summit, filled with windy paths, foggy clouds, free-ranging cows that inhibit traffic
        - A **Must Go** if you ever visit Maui
        - We did two hikes:
            - Halemau'u Trail (Medium Hike)
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2Fp9tJlq-Ddl?alt=media&token=0276d8c3-fc8d-48be-a91c-13e100ee8605)
                - The trail was at an elevation of 8,000' and took ~1 hour overall, stopping at the fork on the Kalemau'u Trail
                - After a **very** rocky trail going down elevation, we were rewarded with a fantastic view
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F9TrAXuB8Cb?alt=media&token=bf8ab578-6c78-430b-bb2e-020c1662ff85)
            - Sliding Sands Trail (Hard Hike)
                - This trail is at an elevation of 10,000' and is no **joke**. I recommend you to be in somewhat good shape because the hike will wreck you otherwise. However, if you are willing to hike this trail, you will definitely be rewarded with exorbitant views and scenery.
                - Starting at an elevation of 10,000', you quickly descend 3,000' into the crater of Haleakala, where the ground starts to turn into a sand consistency

                - The view

        - **[Sunset](<Sunset.md>):** (6:33pm)
            - Haleakala is also known as one the best places in the world to see Sunrises. However, due to such a strong demand sunrises must be reserved 60 days out. So we decided to do the next best, Sunset
            - Parked our jeep to view the Sunset
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FalWRg4ic_G?alt=media&token=13050905-126f-47e8-8362-e6b0e708e34e)

    - **[Leilani's On the Beach](<Leilani's On the Beach.md>):**https://www.leilanis.com/
        - Leilani is secretly two restaurants in one, you are allowed to choose between indoor dining or beachside grill, each with a diff menu
        - We chose beachside grill
        - [Amy Tsai](<Amy Tsai.md>) got fish tacos
        - I got Korean Fried Chicken sandwich
        - KFC sandwich was very tasty however quite expensive at 15.5
