    - [Austin Schlessinger](<Austin Schlessinger.md>) posted our podcast for his Gritty & Curious Podcast. In it, I used an exorbitant amount of "ums" and "like" which I need to fix ASAP. This is not a good way to convey your ideas. It makes you sound not confident when in reality you are.
    - Today I really need to focus and finish reading [LB:The Design of Everyday Things](<LB:The Design of Everyday Things.md>). So far the Book is average at best. For a book that is discussing design, the book's structure and format is horribly designed. I will say there are a several good points in the book, but it becomes very redundant and repetitive as the book goes on.

    - ‚ÄúIn human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry. So often men trip by being in a rush. If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act, he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then, once he had accepted the end as desirable, he should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means. By this method he would not be moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear. Very few people learn this.‚Äù - John Steinbeck [quotes](<quotes.md>)

    - My take on online security:
        - Security is important but there are times where calculated risks should be taken. If the worry of security is hindering my ability to create, meaningful work, then at that point we should take a risk and chances.
        - For instance, posting on Twitter. I am sure this opens an attack vector to collect OSINT on my thoughts and beliefs but I take this risk in the hopes of posting meaningful content. If the things I am posting is not worth this risk, don't post it.
