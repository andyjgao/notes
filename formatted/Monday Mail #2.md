    Hey Everyone,
    Welcome to the 2nd Monday Mail! I try to make it the best email you receive throughout the week so please let me know if there's anything you like or dislike.
    This week has been very exciting for me and I can't wait to share the things I've created and learned. 
    Without further ado, here are the highlights of the week:
    ## My Highlights:
        **Pomotab: ** I was really frustrated there was no minimalist Pomodoro Timer on the web so I decided to build one instead. You can check out the Chrome Extension I made [here!](https://www.andyjgao.com/projects/pomotab/)
        **3 Pillars of Productivity:** I wrote a [new article](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/3-pillars-of-productivity/) generalizing the 3 productivity principles I've learned from trying many different productivity systems.
        **Podcast:** I recorded a podcast this week with my friend Austin Schlessinger this week about blogging, learning, and the future of education. It should be coming out in the next couple of days. You can follow [his podcast here](https://samaustin.blog/podcasts/). 
    ## Reading Highlights:
        **Re-framing Goals: ** I read an awesome tweet this week by David Vassallo that talks about reframing goals. He writes:
            Goals tend to get in the way of letting you do what you should be doing.

I prefer setting a direction instead of a goal. Goals are not meant to be modified frequently, but a direction can be corrected freely whenever new information becomes available.
        We often set goals for ourselves that become fixed targets. But as individuals, we grow and change every day, and the goals we set do not accurately represent what we want anymore. As a result, setting directions aligns far closer to our intentions than the goals we set. 
        **Problems of the Current Education System: ** Since graduating college, I've been constantly thinking about how college could have been better. This week, I read an [article](https://www.perell.com/blog/teaching-like-a-state) by David Perell that kind of put my thoughts onto paper. 
        Some Key Takeaways:
            1. Education currently is very standardized. In order to graduate, you need to follow a very rigid path and satisfy many requirements.
            2. Grades are a terrible indicator of learning.
            Neil deGrasse Tyson: "When students cheat on exams, it's because our school system values grades more than students value learning.‚Äù
            3. We learn best when we are curious. An since curiosity is unstructured, so should learning.  
    ## Beverage Highlights:
        **Coffee vs Tea: ** I've noticed recently that if I drink too much coffee, I become extremely agitated throughout the day. At the same time, tea just doesn't wake me up the way coffee does. There's a lot of debate as to which is the superior drink but I've found that they work best when we use them both. 
            I drink Coffee to wake up. It's the activation energy I need to start my day.
            I drink Tea to sustain me. When I am feeling a bit tired or groggy, I drink tea. There's still caffeine but its a lot less jittery than coffee.
    ## Picture Highlights:
    I caught Happy snoozing with his cuddle buddy.

    Until next week,
