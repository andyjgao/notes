    Hey there,
    Some life updates! 
    This past Sunday was the commencement and Virtual Conferral of Degrees for Carnegie Mellon. Although I already graduated last semester, this University-wide Zoom Call officially marks the end of my time as a student. 
    While college has been the most challenging 3.5 years of my life so far, it's pushed me beyond what I thought I was capable of and given me best friends and mentors for life. 
    With that being said, I'm so excited for the next chapter of my life: **Adulting**.
    Okay, enough sappiness. Onto the highlights: 
    ## ðŸ˜ŠMy Highlights:
        **Spur Growth with Feedback:** I wrote a [new article](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/spur-your-growth-with-feedback/) discussing how I use feedback as a method to exponentially accelerate learning and growth.
        **Personal Notebook:** Inspired by the works of [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes), I created a [public notebook](https://notebook.andyjgao.com) of my own. The notes I write are distilled from the books, articles, podcasts, and essays I consume. Each "note" is written as a claim I believe in. 
    ## ðŸ“– Reading Highlights:
        **The days are long but the decades are short:** This is one of the many gems Sam Altman writes in his [timeless article](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) of life advice. I often re-read the article whenever a major life event happens in order to realign my intentions. While in college, I remember one specific piece of advice Sam Altman gives that strongly resonated with me:
            "Itâ€™s difficult to do a great job on work you donâ€™t care about.Â  And itâ€™s hard to be totally happy/fulfilled in life if you donâ€™t like what you do for your work."
        Life is too short to be focused on things you don't love. While Sam mentions work specifically, this applies to the people you surround yourself with as well.
        **The secret to creative success is disequilibrium:** Or to put simply, look for things in life that surprise you. 
            In [this masterpiece](https://reading.supply/@ava/how-to-write-and-what-to-write-about-from-12-28-2018-W4o1Sb), (seriously I reread this article 5 times), Ava Huang discusses her struggles to write after exhausting all of the topics shes used to.
            Ava comes to a realization:
            __The secret to creative success is disequilibrium, which is to say noticing things in the world that confound you. When we pay attention, we see things that disturb our expectations of how life should be. Our surprise revises us. __
            Wow. 
        **Knowing too much can be bad:** Is there such thing as too much information? Surprisingly, yes. I read an insightful [tweet thread](https://twitter.com/TaylorPearsonMe/status/1261339359183360000) this week by Taylor Person showing how__ knowing too much can actually lead to worse predictions.__ 
    ## ðŸ“º Television Highlights:
        **Money Heist:** The past week, Amy and I have been binging __Money Heist__ on Netflix and I've got to say, it's probably some of the best television I've watched in a while. We've already watched around 20 or so episodes and it still getting better! If you watch it, please let me know what you think.
