- Draft for Liam
    Liam,
    I am inspired by how you live your everyday life. When you put your heart in something, you will do everything possible to achieve excellence. I saw this in Pledging. Every week, you made sure every task was in line and prepared before each meeting and workshop. I saw this in friendships. Whether you had time or not, there was always an availability when someone needed help. I saw this in school. Beta Gamma Sigma, Poets & Quants. These are not achievable unless you demand excellence from yourself. 
    Little did I know, when you selected me to be a part of your pledge team, how rewarding the experience was going to be. Through this, I was able to get to know you better and discover the affinity for books we both share. Whether it be over a refreshing can of Iron City or a nice platter of wings, I thoroughly enjoyed each one of our conversations. 
    Thanks for being such a great friend. I am honored to be a small chapter in the story of a boy from Burgettstown, destined to achieve great things.

- Draft for Anu
    Anu,
    I remember first meeting you freshmen year when we both lived together in Stever. To think that we would end up on the same pledge team 4 years later is crazy-- but I am so glad I did. Through this experience, I got to know you so much better.
    You are one of the most approachable and friendly people I have ever met. Every time I am with you, we always somehow stumble on somehow you know or met. At times, I am convinced you know everyone in Pittsburgh-- its just a testament to your friendliness.
    I am so thankful to share the memories of spending hours together pledging the AZ. From grading extremely poor brother quizzes to the nights we went out as a team, you always livened up our entire team with chaotic good energy.
    I will be sure to visit you when I get the chance to come to Pittsburgh.
