        - We define Areas as being a topic or theme that has a standard maintainable over time. We definite a project as a series of tasks linked to a goal with a deadline.
        - By creating Areas that are broken down into Projects, we are able to break down something that is not quantifiable into actionable tasks. Project Tasks are clearly defined and thus require very little "mental processing" to figure out the next steps. This is useful because it allows you to maintain motivation over the long-run for Areas of your life you are passionate about. It is also useful as a unit of progress towards long-term goals. We are able to see how much we progress in an Area via how many projects we have completed
