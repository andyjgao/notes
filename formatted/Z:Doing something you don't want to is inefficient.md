        - We often hear the mantra that if you don't like doing something, pushing through the hardship will lead you to some reward. Not only is this a bad mantra, it is also bad for your morale and chances are it is not worth whatever reward you get at the end.
        - Instead, a better mantra is "Never do something you don't want to". This is because when you do something you want, this activity will feel 10x easier, leading to increased latency and throughput. If, at any point you no longer feel a desire to continue a task, take a break and work on something else that feels easy, and come back.

Education, as it is right now, is not designed in a way to how humans behave. As a result, there is a strong disparity between a college's price point and its value. Humans are not machines and have many interests and passions. Following a standardized curriculum or "major" hinders this. Instead, a better approach in designing education is to acknowledge the ephemeral nature of human interests and give students all of the resources possible to seek their passions. This will not only maximize student productivity/output because [Z:Doing something you don't want to is inefficient](<Z:Doing something you don't want to is inefficient.md>)
