        Multitasking is a terrible mental model to follow. When we multi-task, we are dividing our attention amongst the various activities we are "multi-tasking".
        In computers, concurrency is equivalent to multi-tasking. It allows a computer to perform multiple processes at once.
        Concurrency works differently depending on how many cores (brains) a computer has.
        If a computer has multiple-cores, concurrency is done through parallelism and every core takes on a task. This is true multi-tasking.
        If a computer has a single-core, concurrency is performed through context-switching or switching from one task to the other continuously which creates an illusion of multi-tasking.
        As humans, we only have one core and thus we can only context-switch which invalidates multi-tasking.
        But since we are not computers, when we switch tasks, it takes time to re contextualize ourselves to the task at hand leading to loss of time and the introduction of errors.
        Thus, when we multi-tasking we not only lose time but also produce lower-quality work.
        Single-task instead.
