    - Notes:
        - You must publicize your ideas because a private idea is as good as no idea at all. Ideas and thoughts are meant to be written down, discussed and expressed.
        - If all scientists kept their ideas to themselves, there would be no innovation.
        - Publicizing your ideas also keeps you vulnerable, accountable, and open for collaboration.
