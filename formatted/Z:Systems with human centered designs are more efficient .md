        As we have seen in [LB:The Design of Everyday Things](<LB:The Design of Everyday Things.md>), non-human centered design leads to a lot of inefficiencies. (For instance, when we design a stove and the controls are not in the same spatial arrangements as the layout of the stove, we will get easily confused as to which control maps to which stove). 
        Education, as it is right now, is not designed in a way to how humans behave. As a result, there is a strong disparity between a college's price point and its value. Humans are not machines and have many interests and passions. Following a standardized curriculum or "major" hinders this. Instead, a better approach in designing education is to acknowledge the ephemeral nature of human interests and give students all of the resources possible to seek their passions. This will not only maximize student productivity/output because [Z:Doing something you don't want to is inefficient](<Z:Doing something you don't want to is inefficient.md>) but also increase overall happiness. 
        We see non-human centered design in governing philosophies as well. 
        Communism fails because it goes against human intuition. All rational humans are self-interested. Thus, giving up all of your earnings to the government and allowing them to redistribute it creates a dissonance between communism and human behavior. From history, we know that communism is an inefficient form of governing.
        Capitalism works because it's designed to serve people's self-interests and thus aligns properly with how humans operate. As a result, we see far fewer inefficiencies in capitalism (which is not to say there are no flaws.)
        Greed and desire are innate in humans, animals etc. Ephemeral interests are innate in humans. We should design systems so that it matches human behavior.
