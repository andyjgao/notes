        - Woke up at ~8am but went back to sleep and woke up 2 hours later ~10am. Then I proceeded to potato for another 30 mins. That is 2hrs 30mins wasted. I need figure out a way to fix this.

        - David's Lessons:
            - Why Twitter is valuable
                - It's valuable because of the instant feedback on your thoughts
                    - makes it useful for writing, entrepreneurship, anything where writing and expressing thoughts are important
                - Twitter posts should offer insight
            - How to write a good tweet
                - Make sure to compress and** compact your ideas** as much as possible
                - **Don't use hashtags**, instead reply to famous people with insightful responses. Twitter even recommend to **limit posts to 2 clickable texts**
                - **Simplicity**- People browse Twitter, they don't read it
                - **Novelty/Insight** - Post new insightful points. Write tweets that people feel but can't put into words
            -  Curating Feed
                - Who to Follow:
                    - Individuals, Not Publications (No CNN)
                        - Find someone you like
                            - Scroll through the Likes of people you like to find interesting individuals
                    - Avoid Twitter Recommendations
                - Who to Un-Follow:
                    - Spammers
                    - Stressors
                    - **Anything that doesn't add value**
                - Following someone means that you are giving FULL permission for them to brainwash you with their ideas. This means you must curate as much as possible. 
            -  Every Tweet should have one idea.  Make this the starting sentence then explain that one sentence in the second paragraph. The first sentence is a pitch for you to read the rest of the tweet.
            - Have a Test Account
