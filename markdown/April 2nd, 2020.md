        - There are some days where I feel that I have a novel idea and I think it's really cool, but then there are other days where I just feel like I cannot create anything useful in the world. 
    - "How do I feel?"
        - I feel good right now. Slept ~8-9 hours.
        - Went to sleep last night pretty late because [[Amy Tsai]] was sad. I accidentally mentioned to her she should play the piano, but this reminded her of Oreo because that's the last time she played the piano
    - "I hate it when"
        - I wake up past noon and most of the day is gone.
    - "If I change one thing, it would be"
        - Create a routine for myself to continue everyday
- How #Attributes Work (based on my understanding as of [[April 2nd, 2020]])

    - Cols of the Attribute Table denote the specified query and everything in that same level of hierarchy
