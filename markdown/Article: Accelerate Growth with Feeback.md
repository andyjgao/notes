    "I don't like the article. I think you should make it shorter."
    Receiving feedback hurts. And even more so when you've poured your heart and soul into something. It never feels good when something you thought was perfect is criticized so harshly.
    However, it's the secret ingredient to accelerating your growth. 
    I used to take criticism as a personal attack, but now I value every piece of feedback I receive. 
    Here's how I create my feedback loop:
    ## Ask and you shall receive
        If people give you feedback on their own volition, that's great, but you will receive far more when you're proactive about it.  
        Ask for feedback.
        [In my newsletter](https://mondaymail.substack.com/), I always ask for feedback. By doing this, you can collect a database of what people like and what people ignore. This will only help you because then you can create a better article/newsletter/product which will attract a larger audience.   
        You may be surprised at how effective bouncing off ideas with your friends can be. They often save you plenty of time by validating a thought before you've invested hours of time into it. 
        If people think your proposition is terrible, it doesn't mean you should give up. Instead ask why. What they say after this is __especially __important to collect so you can improve. 
        Before you start a project, when you work on your project, and when you think you've completed your project, ask for feedback. I can't stress it enough.
    ## Apply it
        This is perhaps the most important part of this entire process. There's no point in spending time collecting feedback if you don't apply it.
        After you've acquired a stockpile of data points, you can then start grouping by commonalities. If multiple people give you the same advice, chances are its something you need to fix and improve. 
        But there will always be outliers as well. This is the feedback you should assess with a grain of salt and see if it's appropriate. Sometimes it's a key insight that not many people have noticed. Other times it's just haters trying to take you down. 
        With the valuable feedback, you can now start making whatever project you're working on even better.
    ## Iterate
        Feedback doesn't end after one iteration. It's a continual process in the pursuit of striving to be better than before. 
        Once you've received your first round of feedback, produce more projects, and accept more feedback. The faster you can repeat the cycle the better. 
        One way to increase the rate of feedback is to use the internet. By [creating online](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/why-i-created-blog/), you can learn in public and create an engine of serendipity to receive feedback from people you don't even know. And even when you sleep too.
