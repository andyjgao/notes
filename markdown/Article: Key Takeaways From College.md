    Intro
        It's almost been one full semester since I have graduated college. And it has given me some proper time to reflect on my college experience, what I've learned and the lessons I got of out it. Here are some key takeaways:
    ## Find your Community
        I often wonder where I would be if I did not go to college, and specifically __Carnegie Mellon University__. If I attended another college, would my education be different? Perhaps. But only marginally. I taught myself most things in college. Assignments and deadlines were used only as pressure when I was lazy. So what made college special? I came to the realization that colleges' main value proposition is its community.  
        Here, I met so many passionate, hard-working people each striving towards their own goals and aspirations. It pushed me to work harder than I ever had in my life. I met people who challenged my perspectives and changed my interests. I built life-long relationships and found mentors who devoted their time to help me develop. 
        Learning has never been more accessible than present-day. With Youtube, [MOOCs](https://www.mooc.org/), and online courses, it is not farfetched to say I could have learned everything in college without attending. 
        However, the network and friends I gained in college are irreplaceable. 
        I found my community. 
    ## Have a Strong Filter
        College is a time of opportunity. There are countless organizations and activities for any interest. 
        "My advice for you is to do as many activities as possible" I remember hearing from a college senior during orientation. I took that recommendation to heart, and as a freshman joined 15 different clubs ranging from the Asian Student Association to University Poker Club. However, it was almost physically impossible to be engaged in each club while still focusing on school. After one semester, I was already overwhelmed. Homework started piling up and I regularly missed club meetings.
        The advice I received during orientation, I soon realized, was incomplete. You should do as many activities as possible __to find what interests you and focus on those.__ There are so many opportunities where having a strong filter becomes almost essential. I became much happier and productive after dropping out of activities I wasn't passionate about. 
        How do you make the most of your college? **Many Inputs but have a strong filter**
    ##  Pursue Learning, Not Grades
        I came into college majoring in Business. Then, I transferred into Information Systems intending to also minor in Computer Science. But eventually, I dropped the minor before graduating. 
        I was definitely all over the place in college but I gained a key lesson from it. **You should Pursue Learning, Not Grades **
        I started as a business major because I wanted to pursue a career in entrepreneurship and thought it would provide me the necessary skills to do so. After a semester in, I was doing relatively well thanks to my high school econ teacher (You rock Mr. Scinto). But none of the classes interested me. I wanted to __create__ and __build__ instead of learning the 4Ps and the 5Cs of marketing.
        The next semester, I enrolled in programming and math classes outside my major and found them insanely challenging yet exciting. This experience changed my perspective on learning. Everyone has different interests. Limiting yourself by following a curriculum is a terrible way to learn in college. **Instead, you should enroll in interesting classes and let learning guide your curriculum.** (And if your curriculum doesn't allow it, transfer.)
        Taking interesting classes even at the risk of subpar grades has a far higher ROI than the alternative.
