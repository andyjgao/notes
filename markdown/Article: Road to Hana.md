    ### Intro
        The Road to Hana is legendary for it's narrow roads and breathtaking views.  While the entire Hana Highway is only 52 mile, don't be deceived by its short distance. It will take roughly 8-9 hours to traverse the entire road due to the narrow winding roads. Along the road you will find picturesque waterfalls, marvelous food, and a once in a lifetime adventure. 
        The following are a list of the destinations we chose on our Road to Hana adventure:
    ### Twin Falls
        Attractions: Waterfall, Food stand
        Rating: 7/10
        The first place we stopped at was Twin Falls, the first easily accessible waterfall on the Road to Hana. 
        Twin Falls is a private owned Farm producing fresh coconut, pineapple, avocados and more, which you can purchase at the entrance. Amy and I bought the coconut meat (not great) and pineapple juice (delicious).

        The farm also offers a hike to their namesake if you walk little bit further past their entrance. The hike will require you to walk through two small streams before you get to the waterfalls, so make sure to have packed some sort of **water shoe or sandals** to cross these streams, as the rocks are quite slippery and sharp. 
        Overall, Twin Falls is a great place to get your feet wet on treacherous (but fun!) Road to Hana.
    ### Ka Haku Smoke Shack
        Attractions: Food, Friendly Doggos
        Rating: 10/10
        Having not eaten the entire morning, Amy and I ended up here after hearing great reviews online.
        The exterior of Ka Haku Smoke Shack is nothing more than just a tarp that covers a grill. There is no polish at all to this place but that's what makes it so appealing to me.

        As soon as you park and walk up to the shack, you will be greeted by the chef working the grill and his two dogs, Buddy and Luna. 
        Ka Haku offers Huli Huli Chicken (Hawaiian style Rotisserie Chicken) or Ribs. Each come with a bed of Rice and a salad. It's **$20 for a box of either chicken or ribs **(serves 2) or **$30 for both** (serves 3-4).
        We opted for the $20 Rack of Ribs.

        I strongly recommend coming to this place. It's one of the best racks of ribs I have ever eaten.

    ### Garden of Eden
        Attractions: Arboretum, Ducks 
        Rating 8/10
        The Garden of Eden is an Arboretum created by Alan Bradbury, Maui’s first ISA certified arborist and life long landscape designer, and his daughter.
        The Garden of Eden costs **$15 per person** and is a very well designed Arboretum with so many different plants, fruits, trees and views of nearby waterfalls. Some highlights include Banana Plants, 100-year-old Mango Tree, and clear outlook onto the Upper Puohokamoa Falls.

        There are also plenty of ducks and peacocks that roam the garden freely.

    ### Coconut Glens
        Attraction: Dessert
        Rating: 8/10
        Along the Road to Hana, we came across a small ice cream stand, Coconut Glens, selling coconut vegan ice cream.
        Although, a little pricey, **$7 dollars for two scoops** (nothing is cheap on the Road to Hana), the ice cream was very fresh and delicious. Every bite still contained small chunks of coconut flakes.

        We ended up getting the Matcha Mint & Original Coconut Flavors

    ### Waiʻānapanapa State Park
        Attraction: Blowhole, Black sand Beach
        Rating: 10/10
        This was the one **Must VISITS** according to almost everyone who does the Road to Hana
        It's known for its black sand beaches, scenic views of the Ocean, and blowhole. The pictures speak for themselves:

        If you had to choose one place to go to on the Road to Hana, this would be it.
