    - # What is Docker, and why should I use it?
        - **Before Docker:** a developer sends code to a tester but it doesn’t run on the tester’s system due to various dependency issues, however it works fine on the developer’s end.
        - **After Docker:** As the tester and developer now have the same system running on Docker container, they both are able to run the application in the Docker environment without having to face differences in dependencies issue as before.
    - # What is Kubernetes, and why should I use it?
        - Kubernetes is a powerful container management tool that automates the deployment and management of containers. Kubernetes (k8’s) is the next big wave in cloud computing.
        - It’s not enough to run containers; you need to be able to:
        - Integrate and orchestrate these modular parts
        - Scale up and scale down based on the demand
        - Make them fault tolerant
        - Provide communication across a cluster
    - # The difference between Docker and Kubernetes
        - With that said, here’s the difference:
        - **Docker** is used to isolate your application into containers. It is used to pack and ship your application.
        - **Kubernetes** on the other hand is a container scheduler. It is used to deploy and scale your application.
    - ## Basic Docker concepts
        - There are some basic concepts you’ll need to learn and they are:
            - Containers
            - Images
            - Registries
    - ### Containers
        - A container is what you eventually want to run and host in Docker. You can think of it as an isolated machine, or a virtual machine if you prefer.
        - From a conceptual point of view, a container runs inside the Docker host isolated from the other containers and even the host OS. It cannot see the other containers, physical storage, or get incoming connections unless you explicitly state that it can. It contains everything it needs to run: OS, packages, runtimes, files, environment variables, standard input, and output.
        - Your typical Docker server would look like this — a host for many containers:
