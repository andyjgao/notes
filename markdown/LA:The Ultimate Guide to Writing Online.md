    - Notes::
        - [[Z:Writing online is one of the best skills to master]]
            - When you write online, your content starts to work for you. It becomes a recruiter for opportunities, like-minded people, and interesting projects. 
            - You can broadcast an idea without having the need to spend the time to do so.
        - **Websites should have 2 things:**
            -  A "Start Here"
                - Helps readers know where to start
            - A curated list of favorite articles
                - This is especially helpful when you don't have any "revelation" content of your own
                    - Thought Leader Strategy: curating a summary of your favorite authors best works
                    - Idea Strategy: pick an idea/topic & curate a list of best resources on topic
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FJ4ZIxWdK_6.png?alt=media&token=6c58f2b6-71b4-4925-9873-b376728528db)
        - **Master your Distribution:**
            - Set up a sign-up form for email list on your site (but don't be too spammy). It's the most reliable way to reach your audience. You are in control of the distribution. Social media can content ban/censor
            - Optimize SEO 
        - **Default to Action when Writing**
            - The only way to get better at writing is to write. When in doubt, default to action.
            - Consistency develops ability, focus on quantity of quality initially (but if can focus on both)
        - **Five Pillars of Writing:**
            1. [[Z:Default to writing Evergreen content]]
                1. Make content that stays relevant even years after writing it
                2. Write about things that everybody knows, [but nobody around you knows], and you have a unique perspective on.
            2. **Publish Quality Ideas**
                1. Ideas > Grammar > Fancy Words
                2. When publishing quality ideas, take a page out of the copywriters handbook. Write with clarity, energy, and simplicity. Skip the fluff.
                3. Vary sentence length helps with keeping audience engaged
                4. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FRi_55YcTQ2.png?alt=media&token=640ba904-3a71-4ad1-82c3-8909febe491e)
            3. **Be Specific**
                1. Start off by being as specific as possible with your writing/ finding your niche
                    1. [[Nat Eliason]] has an interesting article about why [your blog might need a niche]([[LA:Does Your Blog Need a Niche? Maybe Not]])
                2. Build a targeted audience. Attracting the right people is far more important than simply attracting people
            4. Listen to Feedback
                1. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F7bhbH98kjj.png?alt=media&token=129f2190-2ce1-4032-83b7-6c777cf02428)
                2. Great illustration of how feedback should operate
            5. **Re-package existing work**
                1. Leverage what you consume daily content-wise to create content for yourself.
                    1. [[Tiago Forte]] is a master of repackaging content. This allows him to save so much more time when creating content than the average individual.
                2. __When people think about the return on investment of writing, they overestimate the short-term benefits but under-estimate the long-term ones. Consistency is the name of the game.__
        - **Engine of Serendipity:**
            - Writing on the Internet is the most effective way to meet like-minded peers and colleagues.
            - The benefits of writing online compounds over time because writing has a compound effect. Write something once and you can share it for a lifetime
            - Writing online shifts the paradigm from "finding opportunities" to "receiving opportunities"
            - How to build an online reputation:
                - Pick high value, emerging industry
                - Learn as much as possible
                - Share what you learn on website
        - **Building Personal Monopoly**
            - A personal Monopoly is the intersection of:
                - Your Knowledge
                - Your Personality
                - Your skills
            - Be an early adopter and write about that niche. This will attract a following because you are providing value and paving a way for others to follow
            - "Personal Monopolies let you turn ideas into wealth. As James Dale Davidson wrote in __The Sovereign Individual__:"
                - "“Merit, wherever it arises, will be rewarded as never before. In an environment where the greatest source of wealth will be the ideas you have in your head rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly will be potentially rich. The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of human in parts of the world that never shared fully in the prosperity of industrial society. The brightest, most successful and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals.”"
        - **Purpose of Writing**
            - It broadcasts ideas of who you are and creates an open invitation for other people to create opportunities for you
- Highlights:
    - [The Ultimate Guide to Writing Online — David Perell](https://www.perell.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-online)
        - Content builds on itself. It multiplies and compounds.
        - Day and night, your content searches the world for people and opportunities. Projects, mentors, speaking gigs, job offers, pitches, investment opportunities, interview requests, podcast appearances, and invitations to special events. It all starts with sharing ideas online.
        - Leverage is a force multiplier on everything you do and every decision you make, and once you gain it, you can achieve things that once looked impossible.
        - When you create content, people can access your knowledge without taking your time. You no longer need to sell knowledge by the hour. Your ideas are the most valuable currency in a knowledge-driven economy. Just as an investment account allows your money to grow day and night without your involvement, content does the same with your ideas.
        - Invest in your future. Whether you want to become an author or an entrepreneur, you should start writing online. No matter what kind of book you want to write or what kind of company you want to start, it pays to have a smart and targeted audience.
        - **Create an Online Home**
            - Your website needs a “Start Here” page. Think of this page like the waiting room at a train station, where visitors go to find signage, kiosks, timetables, and other relevant information.
            - When you publish ideas, you create your own “Serendipity Vehicle” – a magnet for ideas and people and opportunities from potentially every corner of the globe. If your ideas resonate with people, people will discover you and bring you unexpected opportunities. They’ll open doors you never knew existed.
            - When you first begin writing, before you publish anything, your website should have two things:
                - 1) Start Here
                - 2) A curated list of favorite articles
                - ![Your Online Home should have a Curated Links and a Start Here page](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/55576406e4b02e4679105dc2/1557422133398-E2L5IOOEW77Z253V2YYY/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAHOs6R4j4l09-oc0eg54mUUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcjQtyvpg10TM6Jq5xzrR-OTwBKaj4MLoqVjDfAstvax7NuOLH4VS6iPdlw4vT-V5F/e5fa3a028d941132b32e60077cf2a60082785d7a_2_1380x776.jpg?format=1500w)
        - **Set Up Your Personal Microphone**
            - Distribution is king.
            - When you first begin writing, you can’t expect to hit publish and have the entire Internet show up at your door. It doesn’t work like that. You need an audience of people who want to read your writing, and the more directly you can connect with them, the better.
            - You can’t launch your random, no-name blog and expect people to magically find it.
            - Email reduces your dependency on volatile social media platforms, which makes it the best place to direct your efforts.
            - When it comes to reader stickiness, nothing beats email. Nothing. Email is a direct distribution channel, which makes it sticky and valuable. People keep predicting the death of email, when in reality, it just keeps getting stronger. It’s a direct line to your most loyal and dedicated followers. People who sign up for your email list care about your ideas, and by putting in their email, they give you explicit permission to email them. Trying to build an online audience without an email list is a rookie mistake.
            - Make it easy for people to sign up for your [email list.](https://www.perell.com/join) Add a sign-up button on your website, but respect your guests and don’t ruin the usability of your site with annoying full-page pop-up banners.
            - To rank well on Google, you’ll need SEO (Search Engine Optimization). When you first launch your website, it will be almost invisible to Google and other search engines.. Google’s algorithm depends on trust, and building trust takes time. Links are the bedrock of SEO, and your SEO ranking will only rise once trusted websites start linking to it.
            - Building an audience takes time. It’s a slow process, but don’t let that fact turn you off. That’s what makes having an audience so powerful. An audience is valuable because it takes time to build. If it happened quickly, it wouldn’t be a sustainable advantage.
            - Trust, credibility and authority can’t be purchased. They must be earned, and that’s why they’re so precious.
        - **LEARN TO WRITE CLEARLY AND PERSUASIVELY**
            - Most people have reservations or fears about publishing their writing. They don’t get started because they “don’t have a voice,” “haven’t found their niche,” or “don’t know what to say.” Trust me. I’ve heard every objection under the sun. But there’s only one way past this stage: Develop a bias toward action.
            - Create. Create. Create.
            - Focus on quantity over quality at first. If you publish something every week for a year, you’ll gain tremendous insights into what you should be creating.
            - Consistency develops ability, so pick a schedule and stick with it.
            - I use an [active, social, and collaborative](https://www.perell.com/blog/maximize-creativity) approach to writing. Most of what I “write” doesn’t even happen on the page. It happens while I’m away from the computer, when I’m in the line at the grocery store, waiting at the airport, or speaking with friends.
        - **THE FIVE PILLARS OF WRITING**
            - The best online writers are driven by five pillars: (1) evergreen content, (2) quality, (3) specificity, (4) listening to feedback, and (5) building a body of work.
            - **1. WRITE EVERGREEN CONTENT**
                - Evergreen articles are the foundation of most successful blogs because they stay relevant and can generate traffic for years and years. If an idea won’t be valuable three years after you publish it, don’t write about it. Prioritizing evergreen articles is the single best constraint you can give yourself. By writing evergreen pieces, you’ll attract loyal and intelligent readers who can trust that your writing won’t lose value as their eyes scroll down the page.
                - Write about things that everybody knows, [but nobody around you knows], and you have a unique perspective on.
                - You don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Many of the best writers I know began by summarizing other people’s evergreen ideas, and since they were popular, they already know the ideas will be interesting or useful. If you have the best summary of a popular evergreen topic, you’ll build an audience.
            - **2. PUBLISH QUALITY IDEAS**
                - Skip the usual writing books and learn copywriting.
                - Copywriters are masters of the written word. They write with clarity, energy, and simplicity, which is exactly what readers on the Internet are looking for. They write in specifics, not generalities. There’s no fluff.
                - Great writing is like a dance, and words are the music that create the atmosphere.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F5hzCSTfgIi.png?alt=media&token=1ecb8fc0-ffda-4381-941e-a36f4e875c6d)
            - **3. BE SPECIFIC**
                - Try to tap into one narrow vein of interest that nobody else is addressing in quite the same way as you.
                - The true magic of the Internet is its ability to attract like-minded people from far-flung places, who you’d never be able to meet otherwise.
                - By trying to appeal to everybody, you’ll end up appealing to nobody.
                - Build a targeted audience. The more narrow and niche the topic, the better. Attracting the right people matters much more than the number of people who read your work. Intelligent readers want depth, nuance, and specificity. Speak their language, and ignore the temptation to write for the lowest common denominator.
            - **4. Listen to Feedback**
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F7bhbH98kjj.png?alt=media&token=129f2190-2ce1-4032-83b7-6c777cf02428)
            - **5. RE-PACKAGE YOUR EXISTING WORK**
                - If you want to build an audience, you need to refine your ideas and change how you distribute the ideas you’re already thinking about. Instead of creating __new__ ideas, you should save and redirect the flow of your existing ones. Once you’ve developed a system for publishing at a consistent pace, you can turn your attention to building a body of work.
                - Consistency is the name of the game. Without a consistent writing habit, you won’t succeed as a writer. Start slowly, keep writing, and don’t stop.
        - **CONNECT WITH ANYONE**
            - Writing on the Internet is the most effective way to meet peers and colleagues like yourself.
            - Unlike the time you spend at networking events, the benefits of writing online compound over time. Like any smart investment, it builds on itself. Write something once and you can share it for the rest of your life.
            - By writing online, you’ll lose the “outbound” perspective and adopt an “inbound” one. The paradigm flips once you have a following around your ideas. Once you attract a critical mass of like-minded individuals, you can __attract__ opportunities instead of searching for them. It’s about the quality of readers you attract, and about the relationships you build with people around the world, based on the quality of your ideas.
            - In short, you can build an online reputation in three steps:
                - Pick a high value, emerging industry.
                - Learn as much as you can.
                - Share what you learn on your personal website.
        - **BUILDING A PERSONAL MONOPOLY**
            - A Personal Monopoly is the unique intersection of your knowledge, personality, and skills that nobody else can compete with. Personal Monopolies aren’t found. They’re created.
            - Once you’ve found your niche, write about every aspect of it. The history. The people. The key concepts. Explore every nook and cranny, and write about the best things you discover.
            - Pick a small, but ever-growing market and learn everything you can about it. Build expertise before the other settlers arrive. Then, share everything you learn. If you can create a body of work before the wave of popularity arrives, you’ll be well positioned to capitalize on it when other people are looking for an authority.
            - Personal Monopolies let you turn ideas into wealth. As James Dale Davidson wrote in __The Sovereign Individual__:
                - “Merit, wherever it arises, will be rewarded as never before. In an environment where the greatest source of wealth will be the ideas you have in your head rather than physical capital alone, anyone who thinks clearly will be potentially rich. The Information Age will be the age of upward mobility. It will afford far more equal opportunity for the billions of human in parts of the world that never shared fully in the prosperity of industrial society. The brightest, most successful and ambitious of these will emerge as truly Sovereign Individuals.”
        - **THE PURPOSE OF WRITING**
            - Writing on the internet is a career fast-track.
            - Each article is a sales pitch for your knowledge on that topic. It’s an always-on broadcast of who you are, and an open invitation for other people to create personal and career opportunities for you. It’s a Serendipity Vehicle that can grow automatically, independently of your efforts.
