    - Hiking is an allegory for life
- [[Hawaii]] Day 5: Maui
    - Road to Hana:: https://roadtohana.com/road-to-hana-map.php
        - Twin Falls:: Stop 1 https://www.twinfallsmaui.net/
            - The first easily accessible waterfall on the Road to Hana
            - This place is privately owned and is a Farm that sells fresh coconut, pineapples, etc to incoming visitors
            - Twin Falls also have a hike that requires you to walk through water 2 times before you get the waterfall where Twin Falls gets its name
            - Hike is pretty easy but make sure to bring flip flops or water shoes to cross water as the rocks are slippery and pointy

        - Ka Haku Smoke Shack:: Stop 2 (Lunch) 
            - By far my **favorite meal** in Maui, 10/5
            - The exterior of the Ka Haku Smoke Shack looks exactly as how it is named: it looks like a shack. There is no polish at all at this place but that's what makes it so appealing to me.
            - Once you park and walk up to the shack, you will see a man and his two dogs (Buddy and Luna) working a grill with ribs and Huli Huli Chicken (Hawaiian styled Rotisserie Chicken)
            - It's $20 dollars for a box that serves 2 (choose between either ribs or chicken) or $30 dollars to have both which serves 3-4
            - The box comes with Rice and a salad mixed in vinaigrette
                -  ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FL5z-k4F0HV?alt=media&token=cdf6bf7c-52de-4fed-9fed-2634dabe846e)
            - **Bonus**: Dogs are super super friendly and will stare at you with their beautiful eyes looking for food
            - Buddy:

        - Garden of Eden:: Stop 3 https://mauigardenofeden.com/
            - An Arboretum created by Alan Bradbury, Maui’s first ISA certified arborist and life long landscape designer, and his daughter
            - Best comparison to this is an outdoor version of Phipps Conservatory except even that is a poor comparison
            - Its a beautiful garden filled with different plants,fruits,trees as well as peacocks and ducks
            - Definitely worth a visit if you are traveling on the Road to Hana
            - $15/person

        - Coconut Glens:: Stop 4 (Snack)
            - A small ice cream stand selling coconut vegan ice cream
            - Very Delicious (you can taste the coconut chunks inside the ice cream)
            -  A lil pricey $7 for 2 scoops

            - We got Matcha Mint & Original Coconut

        - Waiʻānapanapa State Park:: Stop 5
            - One of the **MUST VISITS** touted by all those who do the Road to Hana
            - It is known for black sand, scenic views of the ocean, and a blowhole
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FixfEbZFk8O?alt=media&token=15a78b39-3be4-41ef-a4b1-0b488bd40078)

        - **Rest of Road to Hana**: Drive Back
            - Thank god for our Jeep (see "Rental guy convinced us to get a JEEP")
            - The road back was extremely bumpy and there were parts on the Road where we were driving on the edge of a cliff and the guard rail had been rusted off, thus having nothing between us and the 1000 foot drop to the bottom of the ocean
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FEgFymJyWaO?alt=media&token=37a1e444-4b45-4c50-a4fa-f468c72487d7)
    - Poi by the Pound::https://www.poibythepound.com/
        - A restaurant frequented by locals known for their Poi (mashed Taro)
        - [[Amy Tsai]] and I got the Hawaiian Plate for $25 which included:
            - kalua pork, pork laulau, chicken long rice, side of poke, lomi salmon, poi, and mac salad
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FhjIx1tCyMk?alt=media&token=b5d027a9-51ac-435f-958b-ded9064be360)

        - We got Mud Pie for dessert:
            - A massive Ice cream cake filled with chocolate, whip cream and delicious goodness
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2F-IuKB9pz6G?alt=media&token=ff61cd82-be87-42cd-b7ff-4faedbc5cdf7)
        - A very, very solid meal. All of the food were true Hawaiian and I highly recommend if you want to try an authentic Hawaiian meal.
