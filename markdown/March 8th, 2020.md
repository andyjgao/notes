- [[Hawaii]] Day 3: Oahu -> Maui
    - Woke up ~8am
    - Headed to the Beach to take a final look at the beachside in Waikiki
        - Twas beautiful
    - Went back home and finished packing everything
    - Before heading to the Airport, we decided to get a final meal at an udon place
    - Marukame Udon Waikiki:: https://www.facebook.com/marukameudon/
        - Its a casual dining restaurant where you walk down an isle and:
            - You grab a tray
            - First person asks you which udon you want from their menu
            - Makes the udon really quick and gives it to you on your plate
            - Choose from an array of tempura options
            - Pay at the end
        - Perhaps the second most value meal I had on the island, very filling but a little too salty for [[Amy Tsai]] and my taste
        - We got Kara-age Udon

    - After lunch, we checked out of hotel and went to airport to fly to Maui
    - In Maui, we got a rental car
        - Originally, a sedan
        - Rental guy convinced us to get a JEEP
            - Initially, we felt like we were gypped after realizing the total cost came out to be $266
            - We found out eventually that, bc we had booked via Costco renting out a Jeep  was far more expensive
            - After coming to terms with this, we decided we were okay with the Jeep

        -  **Pro TIP**: Getting a Jeep or SUV is a really good idea if you want to drive around Hana esp the [[Road to Hana]]
    - We Stayed at the [Royal Lahaina Resort: An Oceanfront Lahaina, Maui Hotel](https://www.royallahaina.com/)
    - **Captain Jack's Island Grill**:: https://www.captainjacksmaui.com/
        - Located in the Wharf Cinema Center Shops
        - Pretty pricey for okay food
        - [[Amy Tsai]] got a salad and calamari
        - I got a Steak Salad
        - Best part of the meal was probably the Maui Brewery's Pineapple Beer
        - Overall, 6/10
    - Front Street in Lahinia has a good amount of shops to browse
    - Ululani's Hawaiian Shaved Ice:: http://ululanisshaveice.com/
        - Really Really Large portions of Shaved Ice
        - Very Very Soft, You cannot taste the ice at all, but you will definitely get a brain freeze if you eat too quickly
        - 54 different flavors
        - If you want to have a true Shaved Ice experience in Maui, Ululani is the place to go
        - We got the No ka oi (Mango, Coconut, Passionfruit)
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FcwnnwqsyVM?alt=media&token=1287a35c-1dfd-45e1-bc68-20f765c63a38)
        - Li Hing is a special topping made from salted dried plum that is very popular on deserts in Hawaii (comes from Chinese Culture)
