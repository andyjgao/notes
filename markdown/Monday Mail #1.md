    Hey Beautiful,
    Welcome to the very first Monday Mail! There will never be another Monday Mail 1 again and I want to thank you all for being apart of the inaugural edition of this newsletter. Your support means a lot to me.
    I plan on sending out this newsletter once a week and will try to make it the best email you receive throughout the week.
    Without further ado, onto the highlights of the week:
    ## My Highlights:
        I published two articles this week!
        In [The Compound Effect](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/the-compound-effect/), I discuss how consistency can lead to exponential gains. 
        In [Key Takeaways from College](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/key-takeaways-after-graduating-college/), I write about the 3 main lessons I learned after graduating college.
    ## Book Highlights:
        I am currently reading __The Design of Everyday Things__ and so far its an amazing read.
        Have you ever wondered why there is a metal plate on a door? Somehow, we all intrinsically know that this signifies push. Similarly, when there's handle we to pull. 
        This is known as a **signifier** which is used to signal what appropriate actions to take.  After reading about this, I became increasingly aware of all the signifiers around me. Take a look this week and see how many signifiers you notice.
        I plan on finishing this book sometime this week, so be on the lookout for a new book note.
    ## Food Highlights:
        This past week, I found an amazing [Japanese Curry Recipe](https://www.justonecookbook.com/simple-chicken-curry/) and decided to make it. Here is a picture of the results:

        It's super simple to cook but is immensely rich in flavor.
    ## Fun Highlights:
        Bored at home in quarantine? For the last week or so, Amy and I have been [solving virtual puzzles](https://jigsawpuzzles.io/) together --__yes, its real__-- and it's surprisingly fun. You can play with multiple people, and it almost feels like the real thing.
    ## Picture Highlights:
        Happy is very, very lost in the sauce and does not know how to get back. ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Fandyjgao%2FsKUzSf7twn.png?alt=media&token=d3465666-db0a-4c30-af85-fe4a3c31ff22)
    Thanks for reading! If you enjoyed Monday Mail, I'd love it if you could [share it with others.](mondaymail.substack.com) I also love feedback. If there is anything you disliked or would like included in the next Monday Mail, let me know.
    Until next week,
    Andy
