    Hey Friends!
    The past week I spent a lot of time thinking about **intentions **in my work and in my relationships. These are some of the questions I've been asking myself:
        Are you doing something because you want to or because everyone around you is?
        What do you actually enjoy?
    It's easy to fall into the trap of "Keeping Up with the Jones" and doing something just because everyone around you is. I find that by answering these questions on a consistent basis,  I am able to prevent myself from falling prey to these status games.
    With that being said, let's get onto the highlights:
    ## 😊My Highlights:
        **The Power of Cold Showers:** This week I wrote a [new article](https://www.andyjgao.com/blog/the-power-of-cold-showers/) describing what I learned after taking cold showers for the past 6 months. 
        **Gritty & Curious Podcast:** [The episode](https://samaustin.blog/18-is-college-worth-it-should-i-start-a-blog-online-learning-andy-gao/) I was featured on finally came out! (Please excuse my excess filler words, haha) In it, I discuss the value of college, blogging, and the future of education with my good friend, Austin Schlessinger. In addition to hosting this [podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2Jy96AZemzUkxdMW3LgG0x), he writes a [blog](https://samaustin.blog/) as well. Be sure to check it out! 
        **The Design of Everyday Things Book Notes:** I added __The Design of Everyday Things__ to my bookshelf this week. It's a pretty solid book about the psychology behind design and how to apply design principles to daily life. Check out my notes [here](https://www.andyjgao.com/bookshelf/the-design-of-every-day-things).  
    ## 📖 Reading Highlights:
        **East of Eden by John Steinbeck:** This is a throwback reading highlight. I read this book about a year ago and was reminded of this highlight this week:
            "So often men trip by being in a rush ... he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then, once he had accepted the end as desirable, he should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means."
        It struck a chord with me when I read it last year and it still does now. 
        When you've settled on a vision, **stop worrying** about how/when you'll get there. **Focus** on what you can do at the current moment.  **Step by step** you'll realize that what you thought was impossible is now within reach.
        **Design with the Humans in Mind:** One of the biggest takeaways from __The Design of Everyday Things__ is to design with humans in mind. Figure out how humans behave and design accordingly. 
        A good attempt at human centered design is autocorrect on phones. Because humans are prone to errors, autocorrect helps mitigate typos by correcting them to the right word. What the designers failed to realize is that some words are intentionally spelled wrong due to colloquial reasons. (e.g. LOL)
    ## 📺 Video Highlights:
        **Wrongly Incarcerated Prisoner Sings on AGT:** The best video I watched this week was an Archie Williams's America's Got Talent singing audition. He was **wrongly incarcerated for 37 years** due to an unjust judicial system that falsely accused him of rape charges.  You could hear his pain as he sings in the video. I  shedded multiple manly tears while watching this video.
        **Giant Moose on the Road:** This video put into reality how big an adult moose really is. Blew my mind. https://twitter.com/i/status/1263535031345188866
    ## 📷 Picture Highlights:
        A throwback video of Happy inside a container.
