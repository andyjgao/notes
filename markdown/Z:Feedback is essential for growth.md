        - Feedback is necessary for growth. When focused on a project, people are often blind sighted by the flaws of the task at hand. By asking for feedback, you are able to bring an unbiased lens to critique. The feedback becomes more accurate when collected in large numbers. See [Law of large numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).
