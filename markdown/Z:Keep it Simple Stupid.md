        - Always keep things as simple as possible. Over-engineering things will waste time and make things harder for you in the future.
        - A good example of this methodology is when NASA was tasked to build a pen to work in space, as normal ballpoint pens had difficulty writing in zero-gravity environments. Thus, NASA engineers spent hours and tons of money to develop a pen that works in zero-gravity areas. 
        - Russians also had the same problem but instead just used a pencil. 
        - Thus, the best tools are simple, not over engineered and removes excess features and reduces distractions from the main work.
