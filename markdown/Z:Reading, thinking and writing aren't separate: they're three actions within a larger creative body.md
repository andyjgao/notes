    - Notes::
        Reading, thinking and writing may seem like separate activities but they aren't. We need all three in order to learn and [[Z:Use Writing as the tool for learning]]:
            - We **read **to fill ourselves with ideas and knowledge
            - We **think** to clarify, distill and reconstruct our ideas with previous knowledge.
            - We **write** to reflect these ideas back as a way to process what we learned. We also write to share with the world and [publicize our ideas]([[Z:Publicize your Ideas]]).
